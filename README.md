Since I did not have any python in any of my classes, i do these little projects to learn coding using python!
Sometimes other Projects, especially the one's from University have higher priority, so it can take a while to finish a project!

## next TODO: make the pieces moveable

# chessProject
a little chess board, with the goal of implementing a simple chess AI

## first step
making the game board

## second step 
implementing mouseListeners, etc for input/output of user

## third step 
implementing the chess logic and possible graphic highlighting of valid moves when a piece is for example hovered over with the mouse

## fourth step
trying to build an AI that learns by training to play against itself
